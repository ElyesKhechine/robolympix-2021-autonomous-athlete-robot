# RobOlympiX 2021 Autonomous Athlete Robot
- Competed with a 4-member team to design and build a fully autonomous robot excelling in hockey shooting and basketball throwing.
- Achieved 1.9 mm/m position control error using a PID controller based on position, velocity, and orientation, elevating accuracy by 46%.
- Explored a novel self-tuning control algorithm, adapting parameters in real-time, reducing positioning errors by 24%, and ensuring stability.
